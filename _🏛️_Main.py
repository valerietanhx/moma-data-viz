    The Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) houses one of the largest collections of modern art
    in the world. While people typically experience art museums either by physically
    walking around and appreciating each artwork individually or by browsing works
    online,  we aim to provide a different approach to analysing MoMA's art collection,
    offering a broader overview of both MoMA and modern art as a whole. 
    
    We explore the collection through the lenses of SIGHT and SPACE, using data
    visualisation tools in Python. SIGHT focuses on the artworks themselves, 
    considering their overall formal qualities and visual impact. On the other hand,
    SPACE examines geography, delving into the artists behind the art and their
    backgrounds to gain insights into the collection's diversity. Along the way, we
    also share our methodology, shedding light on our thought process behind the
    analysis.
