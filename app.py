        colours in it with the [ColorThief](https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py)
        module, before converting each hex code to the name of the closest named CSS
        colour with the [webcolors](https://pypi.org/project/webcolors/) module.
        - We then mapped each CSS colour name to one of ten basic colour names:
        red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, grey, and white.
        The mapping was inspired by
        [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp) and
        [Austin Gil](https://austingil.com/css-named-colors/)'s mappings,
