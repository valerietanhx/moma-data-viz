        1. Each image was resized to 3px x 224px x 224px and loaded with PyTorch,
        using an image DataLoader and custom Dataset class for memory-efficient loading.
        2. We made use of ResNet152, a deep neural network used in image recognition.
        This model was loaded and its final fully-connected layer was removed.
        3. Images were fed into ResNet152 in batches of 64. The output of each image was
        a vector of length 2048.
        4. Because some classification types are more common than others, we took a
        smaller sample of more common artforms to achieve a more even distribution.
        5. The resulting vectors were condensed from 2048 to three dimensions using
        sklearn's t-SNE.
        6. Plotly was used to plot the 3D scatterplot above, which was then saved as
        a json file.

        1. [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) was used to download all

        2. For each image, we retrieved an RGB colour palette of the six most dominant
        colours in it with the [ColorThief](https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py)
        module, before converting each hex code to the name of the closest named CSS
        colour with the [webcolors](https://pypi.org/project/webcolors/) module and
        a KDTree data structure, which finds the closest colour in the rgb space
        based on Euclidean distance.
        3. We then mapped each CSS colour name to one of ten basic colour names:
        red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, grey, and white.
        The mapping was inspired by
        [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp) and
        [Austin Gil](https://austingil.com/css-named-colors/)'s mappings,
        but modified slightly by us based on our own perception of the colours.
        4. Plotly was used to create the bar charts above based on the frequency
        of each of the basic colour names across the images.
