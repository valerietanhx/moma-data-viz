        This model is loaded and its final fully-connected layer is removed.
        3. Images are fed into ResNet152 in batches of 64. The output of each image is
        a vector of length 2048.
        4. Because some classification types are more common than others, we took a
        smaller sample of more common artforms to achieve a more even distribution.

        sklearn's t-SNE.

        colour with the [webcolors](https://pypi.org/project/webcolors/) module.

        red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, grey, and white.
        The mapping was inspired by
