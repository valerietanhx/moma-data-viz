# The Sights and Spaces of MoMa

An analysis of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMa)'s art collection.

## Motivation

1. We stumbled upon the MoMa dataset online, found it interesting, and wanted to
analyse it! In particular, we wanted to explore it:
    1. From a broader perspective, rather than looking into individual artists and artworks
    2. (For the SIGHTS theme) By examining the artworks' formal qualities themselves,
    rather than only by aggregating data about the artists
2. We also had several learning objectives we wanted to achieve:
    1. Experiment with plotting interactive graphs in Python (e.g. Plotly)
    2. Learn how to use Streamlit
    3. Practise our pandas / data transformation abilities
    4. Try out crafting a larger cohesive narrative with data, beyond merely plotting graphs
